# Guideline

This project for the edition of *Voyage au pays de la quatri√®me dimension* by Gaston de Pawlowski which is marked up with following TEI rules.

- Do not support hyphenation.
- Each newspaper's edition is described in sourceDesc with msDesc.
- All Chapters has `<div>` and `<head>`.
- Each paragraph has `<p>`.
- All pages is marked as `<fw type="pagenum">`.
- If words had a inccorect spell, it'd be marked as `<choice><sic></sic> <corr cert="high" resp="#dion"></corr></choice>`. This represents to `[sic]` in ordinary annotation.
- French sentence has superscript letters. It is marked up like this. 
```xml
<g ref="#spscrpt">e</g>
<glyph xml:id="spscrpt">
<charProp>
<unicodename>character-decomposition-mapping</unicodename>
<localName>super</localName>
</charProp>
</glyph>
```

- if you use this file, take care about one tag, `<fw>`, please. I marked up the text with `<fw>` tag for citing some phrases very strictly when I write a paper or something kind of documents. That is, in the point of the XML structural view, this tag means unuseful. Analyzing this text as the corpus, you delete or comment out these tags.
